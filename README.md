# fan-asus-ux333fa
Script to control the fan on an Asus X333-FA laptop. As it doesn't seem to work with the existing solutions (fancontrol, ...) I made a few VERY simple scripts in order to be able to turn on and off the fan.

In the current kernel drivers at lest, there is no way to control the speed of the fan in any way, just to turn it on (full speed) or off. As leaving it on was annoying, the script just pulses.

Do not trust this script to keep your laptop cool. But when there is nothing else...better than nothing
